            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3><p>
              An interest of mine that I enjoy is watching movies. I really enjoy the feeling
              of satisfaction after completing a good movie that peaked my interest upon 
              finding out about it. Movies are a good hobby and interest to have and its made me want to
              watch more television and movies to find my favorite genre and characters that I like to see.

            <h2>When</h2>
            <h3><p>
              I Started to watch more movies as I got older when I wanted to pass time and to also
              make up for not watching as much or any movies when I was younger which made me feel like
              I was missing out on a lot of good movies and talents displayed from the directors.
              I started watching some movies at the start of 2022 and watched about 70 films by the end of
              that year.

                <h3><p>
                  I would typically watch movies in my room on my computer, television, or my Iphone. 
                  The way I would find more movies to watch is when I downloaded an app called LetterBoxd
                  that would let you follow others and see what they rate movies and what movies they would
                  log on their profile when they watched it. Some of my favorite movies would be: 
                  The Godfather Part II (1974), ChinaTown (1974), and Eyes Wide Shut (1999).

                    <h3><p>
                      How I got into this interest most likely already has to do with me enjoying and 
                      appreciating art and bodies of media. Movies are an artform and are important when it comes to portraying
                      what humans enjoy to watch and how those interests evolve overtime.

                        <h2>Why</h2>
                        <h3><p>
                          Why I chose this interest that many other people probably have as me is because
                          Like I said earlier, I mostly missed out on a lot of movies growing up and I went
                          to rediscover a lot of good acting and scenery in the movies and see the vision the director and the writers
                          of the movie put on the big screen from their own ideas.
                        </p></h3>
